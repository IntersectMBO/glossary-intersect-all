## Working Conventions

### Pull Requests

Thank you for contributing your changes by opening a pull requests!

To get something merged we usually require:
- Follow the Pull Request template
- Description of the changes - if your commit messages are great, this is less important
- Quality of changes is ensured - through new or updated automated tests
- Change is related to an issue, feature (idea) or bug report - ideally discussed beforehand
- Well-scoped - we prefer multiple PRs, rather than a big one

Please reuse the branch naming for the pull request naming.

### Branch Naming

- When creating your branches please create informative names.
- Using prefixes such as `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/` for branch names are a good start.
- Using the related issue number after the prefix is required.

Examples:
- `feat/123-added-ability-for-dreps-to-change-drep-id`
- `fix/312-fixed-drep-ids-being-reversed`
- `chore/567-bumped-cardano-node-version-to-9`
- `docs/88-tweak-contributing-pr-template-codeowners`

### Commit Messages

Please make informative commit messages!
It makes it much easier to work out why things are the way they are when you’re debugging things later.

A commit message is communication, so as usual, put yourself in the position of the reader: what does a reviewer, or someone reading the commit message later need to do their job?
Write it down!
It is even better to include this information in the code itself, but sometimes it doesn’t belong there (e.g. ticket info).

Also, include any relevant meta-information, such as issue numbers.
If a commit completely addresses a issue, you can put that in the headline if you want, but it’s fine to just put it in the body.

Here are seven rules for great git commit messages:
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters (soft limit)
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line and suffix with ticket number if applicable
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters (hard limit)
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

There is plenty to say on this topic, but broadly the guidelines in [this post](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) are good.

#### Rationale

Git commit messages are our only source of why something was changed the way it was changed.
So we better make the readable, concise and detailed (when required).
