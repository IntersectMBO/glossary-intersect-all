  <dt>Blockchain developers</dt>
  <dd>Larger projects developing applications on top of Cardano.</dd>
  <dt>Branch</dt>
  <dd>A duplicate of a piece of code currently in version control allows changes to be made without affecting the main source code.</dd>
  <dt>Catalyst Circle</dt>
  <dd>A committee assembled by election to perform problem sensing and deliberate issues across multiple areas of the Catalyst ecosystem, including General ADA Holders, IOG, Toolmakers and Maintainers, Funded Proposers, Stake Pool Operators, Community Advisors, and Cardano Foundation.<dd>
  <dt>Catalyst Circle Representative</dt>
  <dd>A Representative who can be elected to The Catalyst Circle during an election. For example, a Catalyst community member can represent Community Advisors within the Catalyst Circle.<dd>
  <dt>Catalyst Technical Council</dt>

  <dt>Charter</dt>
  <dd>A document used to describe a Project or Program in relation to Scope, Deliverables, Resources, and Costs </dd>
<dt>CIP Format: Abstract</dt>
<dd>A short (~200 words) description of the technical issue being addressed.</dd>
  <dt>CIP Format: Backwards compatibility</dt>
  <dd>All CIPs that introduce reverse incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.</dd>
 <dt>CIP Format: Motivation </dt>
<dd>The motivation is critical for CIPs that want to change the Cardano protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol is inadequate in addressing the problem that the CIP solves.</dt>
 <dt>CIP Format: Path to Active</dt>
<dd> A reference implementation, observable metrics, or anything showing the acceptance of the proposal in the community. It must be completed before any CIP is given the status "Active," but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale and reach a consensus before writing any code. </dd>
